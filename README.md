☽ hi ! if you see me sitting on ponytown , odds are i'm off-tab . i just like to keep it open like a little tomodachi i poke every once in a while to keep alive . feel free to send me a whisper , though ! you're also welcome to sit with me / hide behind me . i love little ponytown ints like that ... people are so critter

☽ my most beloved pieces of media are *BAYONETTA* , *SIGNALIS* , subnautica , and little nightmares , and i am also very normal about dead by daylight . otherwise , i know a lot of generally niche pieces of media (mostly video games because i'm a nerd) so feel free to talk to me about anything ! in a similar vein , i am incredibly normal about music . you'll likely see me sitting as characters/people from these things , so , if you recognize me , awesome !

☽ idk i think that's everything . my carrd , twt , and steam are all linked to my github profile , so if you wanna go snooping ... go ahead ! my carrd has my dni/expanded interests on it . have a sticker dump
